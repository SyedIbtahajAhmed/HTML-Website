            <h3>Lisa & Kyle </h3>
                <p>Our friends referred Matt Mason for our wedding and we are SO HAPPY they did. From day one and throughout our whole 2 year engagement, Matt was very helpful, supportive and always went out of his way for us. We connected with him right from the start. Not to mention, his pictures are the best I have seen. They really knew how to capture our big day. Our friends and family were raving about how amazing his pictures were, starting the night of the wedding. We had a few of our pictures the night of available and then our photo album, full gallery of photos and wedding video was up the week after the wedding. We are so happy Matt Mason was apart of our wedding day!</p>

            <h3>Sarah & Chad</h3>
                <p>We were very fortunate to work with Matt Mason as well as his assistant Ben Foster on our wedding day in July! I cannot say enough positive remarks about this duo as they captured the entire day from start to finish within pictures and video! Thanks to Matt and Ben we now can relive our special day by viewing our My Life Fusion video! Our guests were simply amazed by their work which was presented during the reception! There were smiles, laughter, and tears that moved throughout the ballroom while watching this video! Matt worked very closely with my husband and I in the early planning process, but was considered to be part of the bridal party on the actual wedding day as he took the time to get to know each and every bridal party member. He cracked jokes throughout shooting, but also got the job done in a timely manner! The quality of Matt's work is impeccable as I have fallen in love with every single picture that was taken! Not only were the pictures perfect, but the video that was taken occurred at the most appropriate time in order to relive certain parts of our day. I highly recommend Matt Mason Photography for capturing your special day! You will not be disappointed in the work that he creates!! Thank you Matt for making our wedding pictures absolutely the BEST!!!</p>

            <h3>Lauren & Josh</h3>
                <p>I cannot say enough good things about Matt. He took a group of people who had no idea what they were doing and created hundreds of amazing pictures. It's hard to chose our favorites! He was so much fun to work with, both for the engagement photos and wedding day. We had a relatively inexpensive wedding, but the one thing I invested in was the photos. Worth. Every. Penny.</p>
